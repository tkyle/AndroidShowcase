# AndroidShowcase

An Android application built using the MVP pattern.

This application connects to AWS and adds/removes/edits items from a Products table in DynamoDB.

Note: The configuration file that contains the AWS credentials is not checked into this project.

This application connects to the same DynamoDB Products table as the AndroidShowcase-Web website, and changes made in either application are reflected in the other.
